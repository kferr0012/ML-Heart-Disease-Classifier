# Machine Learning Heart Disease Classifier


## Summary

Heart Disease Classifier I built for my graduate-level AI class.
It uses the scikit-learn machine learning library in Python to build and train a machine learning model to predict heart disease.
It uses a real-world dataset hosted on Kaggle and has an accuracy of about ~88% using a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with a 70-30 training/testing split.

## Data
Data is taken from Kaggle.
Dataset contains features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blodd Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting Electrocariodgram Results, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak, Slope of Peak Exercise ST, and a Heart Disease Label.
